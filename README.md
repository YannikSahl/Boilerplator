  An application to create bare bone C# code from .graphml files
</p>

# Overview

This application was designed and developed as part of a university course during the winter semester of 2019/2020.  

The idea was for users to take their .graphml file (a file that contains a UML class diagram) that they created using yEd and turn that into a bare bone code structure.
